## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates and optimizes a real-world **ship pipe manufacturing process** using a powerful evolutionary approach based on the **Shuffled Frog Leaping Differential Evolution Algorithm (SFL-DEA)**. It incorporates:

- ⏳ **Minimization of Makespan**
- ⚡ **Energy-Efficient Scheduling**
- 🏭 **Factory Assignment & Workflow Optimization**
- 📊 **Gantt Chart Visualization**
- ⚙️ **SimPy-based Production Simulation**

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Simultaneously minimizes total production time and energy usage.
- 🧠 **Intelligent Scheduling**: Evolves 100 candidate schedules over 400 generations.
- 📦 **Factory Load Balancing**: Automatically distributes jobs across multiple factories.
- 📈 **Visual Dashboard**: Gantt chart of job timelines and operations.
- 🔄 **Event-Based Simulation**: Realistic modeling of job flow and machine utilization using `SimPy`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Tool            | Description                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🐍 Python        | Core programming language                   |
| 📘 SimPy         | Event-driven simulation engine              |
| 📉 Matplotlib    | Gantt chart generation & visualization      |
| 🧬 NumPy         | Data structures & random initialization     |
| 💡 SFL-DEA       | Custom evolutionary optimization logic      |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Initialize Population**: 100 randomized schedules and factory assignments.
2. **Evolve with SFL-DEA**: Mutation, crossover, and local search improve candidates across 400 generations.
3. **Evaluate Objectives**: Calculates makespan and energy consumption.
4. **Simulate in Real-Time**: SimPy models each job's movement through factories and machines.
5. **Visualize**: Gantt chart shows job timelines, colored by operation.
